# If you have self-generated a CA certificate for your ES cluster nodes, you may
# also need this CA certificate to check certificates while requesting the
# cluster. If defined, this CA certificate will be mounted to
# /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/es-cluster.pem

# We expect this certificate to be pasted in PEM format

# Authentication
#
# For each entry, we expect the following keys:
#
#   - username (str)
#   - hash (str)
#   - scopes (list)
#
# Example:
#
# LRS_AUTH:
#   - username: "foo"
#     hash: "thehash"
#     scopes:
#       - "foo_scope"
#
# For more information about hash generation, see Ralph's documentation:
