# Introduction

Ralph is a toolbox for your learning analytics, it can be used as a:

- **library**, to fetch learning events from various backends, (de)serialize or
  convert them from various standard formats such as
  [xAPI](https://adlnet.gov/projects/xapi/),
- **command-line interface** (CLI), to build data pipelines the UNIX-way™️,
- **HTTP API server**, to collect xAPI statements (learning events)
  following the [ADL LRS
  standard](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#partthree).

## Supported backends

As a library or a CLI, you will be able to read and write from/to the following
backends:

- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [OpenStack Swift](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [OVH Logs Data Platform](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/logs-data-platform/)\*
- [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
- File system

\* _read-only backend_

The LRS server currently supports the following backends to store learning
traces in xAPI format:

- Elasticsearch
- MongoDB

## CLI key concepts

At first, Ralph has been designed as a CLI to batch process your logs using
base commands and UNIX standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout`) to connect them in
a pipeline. A base example pipeline may be:

```sh
$ ralph fetch --backend swift my_archive.gzip | \
    gunzip | \
    ralph push --backend es
```

In this small pipeline, we stream `my_archive.gzip` content from a Swift
container to the standard output (using the `fetch` command), uncompress the
content (using the `gunzip` command), and bulk insert logs in an ElasticSearch
index (using the `push` command).

As UNIX is beautiful, Ralph offers many powerful possibilities by combining its
commands with other standard commands or command line tools.

## Quick start guide

Ralph is distributed as a [python
package](https://pypi.org/project/ralph-malph/) and a [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fundocker/ralph).

> If you choose to install `ralph` in your native environment (without using
> Docker), please make sure that **Python 3.11** is installed (and your default
> python distribution).

Ralph package can be installed from PyPI using the `pip` tool:

```sh
# Create a new virtualenv (optional)
$ python3.11 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

# Install the full package (in a virtualenv)
(venv) $ pip install \
    ralph-malph[backend-es,backend-ldp,backend-lrs,backend-mongo,backend-swift,backend-ws,cli,lrs]

# Install only the core package with the Elasticsearch backend and the LRS (in
# a virtualenv)
(venv) $ pip install ralph-malph[backend-es,lrs]

# Test the ralph command (it should be in your PATH)
(venv) $ ralph --help
```

If you only need to integrate `ralph` models in your project, you don't need to
install the `backends`, `cli` or `lrs` extra dependencies, the core package is
what you need:

```sh
# Install the core library (in a virtualenv)
(venv) $ pip install ralph-malph
```

Alternatively, Docker users can pull the latest `ralph` image and start playing
with it:

```sh
# Pull latest docker image and get usage
$ docker run --rm -i fundocker/ralph:latest ralph --help

# Pro tip: define an alias to ease your life
$ alias ralph="docker run --rm -i fundocker/ralph:latest ralph"
```

Now that `ralph` can be run from your system, we invite you to explore
[available commands](./commands.md).
