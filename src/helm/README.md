# Ralph Helm Chart

## Dependencies

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl`, the official Kubernetes CLI: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/
- `helm`, the package manager for kubernetes: https://helm.sh/fr/docs/intro/install/

## Deploying Ralph

This chart bootstraps a Ralph deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager.

### Setting environment values

All default values are in the `values.yaml` file. With Helm, you can extend the values
file: there is no need to copy/paste all the default values. You can create an
environment values file, _e.g._ `custom-values.yaml` and only set needed customizations.

Some of the environment values, needed for Ralph to work, are expected to be in an
external ConfigMap Kubernetes object. Modify the `manifests/ralph-env-cm.yaml` file
under the root of the chart to reflect your needs, and execute the following command to
create the ConfigMap:
```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/ralph-env-cm.yaml
```

Others environment values, also needed for Ralph to work, are expected to be in an
external Secret Kubernetes object. Modify the `manifests/ralph-env-secret.yaml` file
under the root of the chart to reflect your needs, and execute the following command to
create the secret:
```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/ralph-env-secret.yaml
```

### Creating authentication secret

Ralph stores users credentials in an external Secret Kubernetes object. You can modify
the `auth-demo.json` file to your needs (see [Ralph
documentation](https://openfun.github.io/ralph/latest/tutorials/lrs/authentication/basic/#creating_user_credentials)
on how to do so) and create a Secret object from it with the command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic ralph-auth-secret \
    --from-file=auth.json=manifests/auth-demo.json
```

### Reviewing manifest

To generate and review your Helm generated manifest, under `./src/helm` run the
following command:

```bash
helm template oci://registry-1.docker.io/openfuncharts/ralph
```

### Installing the chart

Ralph Helm chart is distributed on DockerHub, and you can install it with:
```bash
helm install RELEASE_NAME oci://registry-1.docker.io/openfuncharts/ralph
```

Tips:

* use `--values` to pass an env values file to extend and/or replace the default values
* `--set var=value` to replace one var/value
* `--dry-run` to verify your manifest before deploying

## Tutorial: Working on the Helm chart

This tutorial aims at deploying Ralph LRS on a local Kubernetes cluster using Helm. In
this tutorial, you will learn to:

- run and configure a small Kubernetes cluster on your machine,
- deploy a data lake that stores learning records: we choose Elasticsearch,
- deploy Ralph LRS (Learning Records Store) that receives and sends learning records in
  xAPI,

> ðŸ’¡ While working on the Helm Chart, suggested commands suppose that your current
> directory is `./src/helm`.

We recommend using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to run a local
cluster that we will deploy Warren on.

```bash
# Start a local kubernetes cluster
minikube start
```

We will now create our own Kubernetes namespace to work on:

```bash
# This is our namespace
export K8S_NAMESPACE="learning-analytics"

# Check your namespace value
echo ${K8S_NAMESPACE}

# Create the namespace
kubectl create namespace ${K8S_NAMESPACE}

# Activate the namespace
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=${K8S_NAMESPACE}
```

### Deploying the data lake: Elasticsearch

In its recent releases, Elastic recommends deploying its services using Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs) installed via its official Helm chart. We will first install the
Elasticsearch (ECK) operator cluster-wide:

```bash
# Add elastic official helm charts repository
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co

# Update available charts list
helm repo update

# Install the ECK operator
helm install elastic-operator elastic/eck-operator -n elastic-system --create-namespace
```

Since CRDs are already deployed cluster-wide, we will now be able to deploy a two-nodes
elasticsearch "cluster":

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/data-lake.yml
```

Once applied, your elasticsearch pod should be running. You can check this using the
following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```

We expect to see two pods called `data-lake-es-default-0` and `data-lake-es-default-1`.

When our Elasticsearch cluster is up (this can take few minutes), you may create the
Elasticsearch index that will be used to store learning traces (xAPI statements):

```bash
# Store elastic user password
export ELASTIC_PASSWORD="$(kubectl get secret data-lake-es-elastic-user -o jsonpath="{.data.elastic}" | base64 -d)"

# Execute an index creation request in the elasticsearch container
kubectl exec data-lake-es-default-0 --container elasticsearch -- \
    curl -ks -X PUT "https://elastic:${ELASTIC_PASSWORD}@localhost:9200/statements?pretty"
```

Our Elasticsearch cluster is all set. In the next section, we will now deploy Ralph, our
LRS.

### Deploy the LRS: Ralph

First and foremost, we should create a Secret object containing environment values
needed for Ralph. To help us, we have the manifest under
`manifest/ralph-env-secret.yaml`.

Let's replace the `<PASSWORD>` tag by the actual password of the `elastic` user with the
command:
```bash
sed -i -e "s|<PASSWORD>|$ELASTIC_PASSWORD|g" manifests/ralph-env-secret.yaml
```

We can now apply this manifest, to create the Secret object in our local cluster:
```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/ralph-env-secret.yaml
```

We can now deploy Ralph:
```bash
helm install lrs ./ralph --values development.yaml --debug --atomic
```

One can check if the server is running by opening a network tunnel to the service using
the `port-forward` sub-command:


```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/lrs-ralph 8080:8080
```

And then send a request to the server using this tunnel:

```bash
curl --user admin:password localhost:8080/whoami
```

We expect a valid JSON response stating about the user you are using for this request.

If everything went well, we can send 22k xAPI statements to the LRS using:

```bash
gunzip -c ../../data/statements.jsonl.gz | \
  sed "s/@timestamp/timestamp/g" | \
  jq -s . | \
  curl -Lk \
    --user admin:password \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://localhost:8080/xAPI/statements/ -d @-
```

Congrats ðŸŽ‰

### Go further

Now that the LRS is running, we can go further and deploy the dashboard suite Warren.
Refer to the
[tutorial](https://github.com/openfun/warren/tree/main/src/helm#deploy-the-dashboard-suite-warren)
of the Warren Helm chart
